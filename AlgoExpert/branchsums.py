# Write a function that takes in a binary tree and returns a list of its branch sum ordered from leftmost to rightmost branch sum.
# A branch is a sum of all the values in a binary tree branch, 
# a binary tree branch is a path of nodes in a tree that starts at the root node and ends at any leaf node

# Each BinaryTree node has an integer value, a left child node, and a right child node.
# Children nodes can either be BinaryTree nodes themselves or None/null
